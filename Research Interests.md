# Areas of Interest
Theories and insights on human behavior are most valid and representative of true human nature when studied in naturalistic contexts.   
This idea sets the foundation for my projects that aim to model and understand how emotions and social contexts influence human behavior.
These include how empathic behaviors change our perception of pain, how social contexts change our opinions and impressions of others, and how emotions shape our value decisions and learning behavior. To investigate these questions I draw upon a diverse set of research tools such as functional neuroimaging, psychophysiology, and facial expressions while using computational modeling and machine learning algorithms to formalize and make predictions of behavior.

In the process, I have authored and contributed to research tools that may also be useful to others.
