# Areas of Interest
I am interested in understanding why people do the things they do and think the way they think.
More specifically, I build computational models that explain and predict people's behaviors, thoughts, and interpersonal outcomes during social interactions and group decision-making settings. I use methods from psychophysiology (skin conductance, heart rate), neuroimaging (fMRI, intracranial EEG), and facial expressions extracted from face videos to complement experimental behavioral data to augment our understanding of human behaviors and judgments in social contexts. With these broad goals and interests, I have led and participated in a number of projects described below.

## 1. Impact of shared experiences on social connection.
Why is it that we often feel more connected to another person after we watch a movie together, share a meal together, or take a same bus ride together? To answer this questions, we created a shared experience in which participants watched a TV show either alone or with another participant for four hours. By recording and analyzing their facial expressions elicited during the show, we found that more synchronized facial expressions both in time (i.e. smiling at the same moments) and in spatial configuration (i.e. moving same sets of facial muscles) both represent developments of social connection. Overall, this research suggests these facial expression metrics could potentially be used to gauge social connection between individuals that could help design better face-to-face social interaction platforms or organizational activities.

## 2. Understanding how groups make decisions together.
Research on group decisions often ask how accurate group decisions are compared to individuals' when there is a right or wrong answer. However, complex real life decisions often don't have clear right or wrong answers and are often a result of choosing what values (e.g. education, family, environment) and preferences (e.g. food tastes, music tastes) are more important. Using a novel group decision making paradigm, we investigated how individuals' values and preferences are revealed, modified, and integrated in group settings, and compare different models that best represents the value integration process. We also use facial expressions and pose data extracted from video clips recorded during group discussions to evaluate how non-verbal cues and signals can be indicative of each person's role, influence, and satisfaction, with each group decision.

## 3. Building facial expression models of complex and social emotions.
Complex social emotions such as regret, guilt, pain, and empathy are relatively poorly understood compared to the six basic emotions. With decision making paradigms with real outcomes such as painful thermal stimulations applied to oneself or to others, we elicited these emotions in a controlled lab environment while measuring their facial expressions. From this, we built models using the temporal dynamics of facial expressions that predict such emotions as well as how they might be perceived by others. These work may provide new ways to study the role of complex emotions on social interactions and how they guide future behavior and judgments of others.
