When I applied to graduate schools in 2015, I was ready to spend the next
five years of my life in sunshine California. Unfortunately, I was rejected by
all [f](https://www.stanford.edu/)[o](https://www.berkeley.edu)[u](https://www.ucla.edu/
)[r](www.caltech.edu) schools in CA. Even then, I thought it was unlikely that I would end up
at Dartmouth. My alternative option was in [New York City](www.psych.nyu.edu/)
and when I made a table of pros & cons comparing food options, social life,
job opportunities, and dating prospects, Dartmouth never came out on top.

The table of pros & cons, however, did not take into account the nuances
which I ended up giving more weight. In NY, I could meet new people every day
but by spending less time with department colleagues. I could watch
broadway shows and explore new bars but by spending less time at work.
Above all, I didn’t want to live my life in constant FOMO, where I would
be regretful of not taking advantage of the entertainments offered in the city.
That could wait until I get a PhD in five ~~&nbsp;&nbsp;six plus&nbsp;&nbsp;~~ years.


But the real reason Dartmouth remained in contention was because I felt I had clicked with
the soon-to-be [advisor](http://lukejchang.com/) and [lab mate](http://eshinjolly.com).
It’s difficult to explain but it was a gut feeling from perhaps 5~6 hours of
interaction that had me feeling that I would have more fun working with these people.
Perhaps it was this feeling and cognitive dissonance that made up those reasons
to NOT go to NY, but I drove up one more time to check if I could
live at Dartmouth without the dress-ups of the interview weekend just to be sure.
After another few hours of people telling me that I should be aware that Hanover
is a really ~~really really~~ small town, I finally took the plunge and decided
to come to Dartmouth

## Daily life at Dartmouth
This isn’t the most exciting place in the world. It has three bars, maybe six
restaurants (three of them Thai), and three cafes (one of them closes at 3pm).

But you can take it as an opportunity to polish your cooking skills.
Cook up a steak and roasted veggies that you picked up from the local farmers market,
pair it with a beer from the best brewery in the world.  Nightlife is scant, but
you can still go to happy hour for a drink or two and honestly who cares when
most of the nights you'll be [watching Netflix in your bed anyways](https://cdn.someecards.com/someecards/usercards/nothing-says-i-know-how-to-party-like-drinking-coffee-and-watching-netflix-on-a-friday-night--f473f.png).

Despite all this, I think the camaraderie among grad students at Dartmouth
definitely makes up for it. I've made great friends not just in my department
but also in other departments too. We may not have a on-campus grad-housing anymore
(RIP North Park) but we still got the grad lounge for study breaks.
I ran out new Tinder swipes in a day but eventually I met a girlfriend,
whom I've been with for 2.5 years, so maybe the dating life here isn't too bad either.

## Research & Teaching
During the 2.5 years, I was also fortunate to work on various research projects
that helped me develop new skills and knowledge that prepared me for both
academic and industry jobs ~~&nbsp;to be confirmed&nbsp;~~.

I ran fMRI and behavioral experiments through which we investigated how people
sync up in their emotional expressions and neural responses and how they
allow us to infer their impressions of TV characters. In the process,
I've built open-source [equipments](https://psyarxiv.com/p5293/) and toolboxes
that can be used to [extract](https://github.com/cosanlab/affectiva-api-app)
emotion expressions from videos and [preprocess](https://github.com/jcheong0428/facesync),
and [analyze](https://github.com/cosanlab/feat) face expression data.
Participating in these projects have also had unexpected benefits of
traveling to conferences in LA, Boston, Chicago, and NY, as well as
meeting new friends while participating in summer schools such as the
[MIND](https://summer-mind.github.io/) and
Neurohackweek(https://neurohackweek.github.io/).


As a side project, we have also teamed up with a local cafe and have built
an [app](http://lineatkaf.com/) where we estimate wait times and line lengths
using deep learning algorithms to help students get their coffees faster
and help businesses better understand customer needs.

Dartmouth may not be for everyone but it could be a place for you.
Just make sure you know what you are getting into (snow, lots of snow) and
you’ll be fine. If you are already here and feel stuck,
just look at the bright side: you’ll be out of here in
five ~~six or more~~ years.
