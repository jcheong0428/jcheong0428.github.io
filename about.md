    	<td style="padding: 10px 15px; vertical-align: top;"> I am a Cognitive Neuroscience PhD candidate in the <a href="http://pbs.dartmouth.edu/">Psychological Brain Sciences Department</a> at Dartmouth College. I work with Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nCCXMZoAAAAJ&hl=en">Luke Chang</a> in the <a href ="http://www.cosanlab.com/">Computational Social Affective Neuroscience Lab</a>, and study the neurobiological substrates of social and affective decision-making using facial expressions, psychophysiology, and neuroimaging. Previously, I completed my BA in Psychology with certificates in Neuroscience and Finance at Princeton University. Subsequently, I worked as a lab manager for <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eM916YMAAAAJ">Matthew Botvinick</a> at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute.

    I also enjoy using data analytics and machine learning to solve real world problems and have won the <a href="https://dartmouthtcc.weebly.com/">2019 Thayer Consulting Case Competition</a> as well as the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/line-at-kaf">Dartmouth Entrepreneurship Network (DEN) Business and Innovation Award</a>, <a href="https://devpost.com/software/coheal">Best Dartmouth Community Hack</a>, and <a href="https://devpost.com/software/line-at-kaf">Second Best Hack award</a> at Dartmouth hackathons. I also initiated, developed, and deployed project <a href="http://lineatkaf.com">Line@KAF</a> that uses computer vision and neural network models to provide a virtual view of the line at a notoriously busy campus caf√© on mobile and web applications. I enjoy working with others while brainstorming about interesting problems, prototyping apps and ideas, and implementing solutions.
